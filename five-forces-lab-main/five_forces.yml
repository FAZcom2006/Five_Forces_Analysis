# Write your assessment of the rivalry between existing competitors.
competitor_rivalry: >
  The car sales industry is highly competitive, with multiple dealerships, 
  online platforms, and private sellers competing for market share. 
  Companies like AutoTrader, CarGurus, and local dealerships offer similar 
  services, making differentiation crucial.

# Write your assessment of the threat of new entrants.
new_entrant_threat: >
  The barrier to entry is moderate. While setting up a dealership requires 
  substantial investment, online car sales platforms are easier to establish. 
  However, strong brand reputation and trust are critical for success.

# Write your assessment of the threat of substitute products or services.
substitute_threat: >
  Alternatives such as ride-sharing (Uber, Lyft), car rentals, and public 
  transportation serve as substitutes. As urbanization increases, consumers 
  may prefer these options over car ownership.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of customers.
customer_power: >
  Customers have significant power due to the availability of many options. 
  Online price comparison tools make it easy for buyers to negotiate better 
  deals. Customer reviews and transparency further empower buyers.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of suppliers.
supplier_power: >
  Car manufacturers and wholesalers have moderate power. Dealerships rely 
  on manufacturers for stock, but competition between manufacturers (Toyota, 
  Ford, Honda) prevents monopolistic control over pricing.

# Write your conclusion regarding the appropriate competitive strategy to pursue.
competitive_strategy: >
  Our strategy is differentiation. By offering a user-friendly digital 
  platform with virtual car showrooms, AI-based recommendations, and seamless 
  financing options, we aim to provide a superior buying experience.
